## game idea: Player gathers stats based on events + self-input improvement plans.

# Todo for MVP

tech wants - TS, JSX, Redux,

## player

- create a player - stats- hp, strength, int, wis, con, relaxed, idle. Complete :)
- hook up player statefully -- redux or context -- this may not be required.
-

# features

## top bar

- profile - Complete -- requires beautifying
- about - Complete -- requires Beautifying.
- tasks
- (possibly) monsters

# events (would like to have)

- on a timed basis/completion basis, allow for a special mission to appear and be able to complete.
